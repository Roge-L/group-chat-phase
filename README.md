# GroupChatPhase
Make video proposals to schedule and vote on hangout times.

## Inspiration
GroupChatPhase was born out of our personal frustration with the lack of accountability and creativity in scheduling time with friends. We saw an opportunity to create a platform that not only makes it easy to plan hangouts, but also adds a fun and personal element to the experience.

## What it does
With GroupChatPhase we want to bring people closer together and help create meaningful connections through the power of technology. Our goal is to inspire people to be more intentional and thoughtful about spending time with the people they care about, and make memories that will last a lifetime.

## How we built it
We developed a React frontend connected to a Django backend with Twilio for functionality and Auth0 for authentication.

## Challenges we ran into
An MLH email that detailed "everything you need to know" caused confusion that there were more companies and prizes in attendance than we expected; this led to wasting time on frameworks we would not have used in the first place (we had to redo the backend).

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- The amount of functionality we developed
- Integration in such a short amount of time
- Collaboration among team members

## What we learned
- Always double check your email fine printings
- Do not give into sunk costs
